        "body": "Zimbabwe is a country that has seen an estimated 40% of its population migrate due to economic and/or political reasons – the diaspora. The diaspora in turn remit some $2+ billion per annum to their families in Zimbabwe BUT they are denied a VOTE. That’s right the people keeping the general population afloat – are denied a vote – even though it is permitted within the Zimbabwe Constitution. This fact and others are itemised below to clearly show that elections in Zimbabwe are NOT Free they are NOT Fair and they are certainly NOT Credible. Given all this, the regime and its apologists are trying to claim that the Elections now slated to be on 30th July 2018 will be Free and Fair. We are seeking justice and influence from the International Community to ensure that Elections are free, fair and credible in Zimbabwe – at present they are clearly NOT."
